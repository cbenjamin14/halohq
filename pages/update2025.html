			<h3>Warpath Update – Halo Infinite</h3>
			<p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>
			<p><em>Halo Infinite</em> fans have a lot to celebrate with the release of the <strong>Warpath Update</strong>, which marks the 15th anniversary of <em>Halo: Reach</em>. This update brings new content, gameplay modes, and cosmetic rewards that honor the legacy of the Halo franchise while enhancing the multiplayer experience.</p>

			<h4>Overview:</h4>
			<p>The Warpath Update focuses on community-driven content, gameplay balance, and nostalgia. Players can experience fan-favorite modes from previous Halo titles, enjoy revamped maps, and collect special cosmetic items via the Operation Pass. The update demonstrates 343 Industries' ongoing commitment to keeping Halo Infinite fresh and engaging.</p>

			<h4>Highlights:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>Invasion Mode Returns:</strong> This classic mode from <em>Halo: Reach</em> allows players to take part in large-scale battles where one team defends bases while the other attacks. Six maps are included in the rotation, such as Breakpoint and Boneyard (renamed Recovery). This mode is available in a dedicated playlist through October 7, 2025.</li>
			<li><strong>Ranked Legacy Playlist:</strong> Players looking for a pure Halo experience can enjoy traditional gameplay with sprint and motion trackers disabled. Classic modes like Slayer, Capture the Flag, and Oddball emphasize strategy, teamwork, and precise skill, appealing to long-time fans and competitive players.</li>
			<li><strong>Operation Pass:</strong> A 20-tier system provides free and premium rewards, including unique skins, armor coatings, and the iconic Hayabusa helmet, obtainable through The Exchange until October 21, 2025. Completing tiers unlocks content progressively, giving players goals and incentives to keep playing.</li>
			<li><strong>Halo: Reach 15-Year Anniversary:</strong> Commemorative art, special events, and a panel at the Halo World Championship 2025 (October 24–26) celebrate the game's legacy. Fans can look forward to exclusive reveals and insights into the franchise’s future.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Gameplay Tips:</h4>
